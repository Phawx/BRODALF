# BRODALF

BRODALF keeps track of where every copy of your files lives. It is built for
backups on hard drives that spend most of their time unplugged in a drawer,
with consumer cloud storage (OneDrive and Dropbox first) to follow.

The catalog, a `.brodalf` file, holds no file data. It records every file and
folder you protect, every version BRODALF has seen, and every drive a copy of
each version was written to. In the app, files stay greyed out until BRODALF
can see a correct copy on storage that is connected right now.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the design.

## Status

The C core library, the Windows app (`brodalf.exe`) and a command-line
harness (`brodalf-cli`) work. Optional encryption and the cloud hooks come
next. The Go files
at the top of the repo are the earlier prototype and are not part of the C
build.

## Build

You need CMake 3.16+ and a C compiler. Everything else is bundled in
`third_party/`.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release
```

On Windows this works with Visual Studio (open the folder, or use the commands
above from a Developer Prompt) or MinGW-w64. To build a Windows `.exe` from
Linux:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-win -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake
cmake --build build-win
```

## The Windows app

Run `brodalf.exe`, or double-click a `.brodalf` file after associating it.

1. Pick the last catalog, open another, or create a new one.
2. On a new catalog, choose the folders to protect.
3. BRODALF looks for its drives and scans your folders for changes.
4. The tree shows everything you protect. Greyed files have no copy on a drive
   that is plugged in (the label says which drive holds them, if any). Amber
   files have changed, and only an older version is reachable. Red means a
   copy is missing or damaged, and struck-through means deleted from your
   folder. Folders show how many files inside are available.
5. Select a file to see every version and where each copy is.
6. **Back up** copies what is missing to a plugged-in drive, or sets up a new
   one. **Check drive** re-reads every copy. **Restore** writes the selected
   file or folder back out. Plugging in a drive is noticed on its own.

After a backup, everything on the drive lights up:

## Try it from the command line

```sh
brodalf-cli new   family.brodalf
brodalf-cli add   family.brodalf "C:\Users\me\Pictures"
brodalf-cli scan  family.brodalf
brodalf-cli tree  family.brodalf                      # everything greyed out
brodalf-cli drive family.brodalf E:\ "Blue WD 4TB"
brodalf-cli backup family.brodalf E:\
brodalf-cli tree  family.brodalf --drive E:\          # backed-up files light up
brodalf-cli versions family.brodalf Pictures "2024/IMG_0412.jpg" --drive E:\
brodalf-cli check family.brodalf E:\ --full
brodalf-cli restore family.brodalf D:\restored --drive E:\
```
